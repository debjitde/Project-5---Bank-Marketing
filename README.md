# Project-5---Bank-Marketing

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

In this project, two datasets has been used:

1.bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014].
2.bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs).
